# CRC-Attack-WEP

WEP uses encrypted CRC as the integrity protection mechanism.
However, there is a flaw in the mechanism and the attacker can selectively flip some bits of the message.

I illustrate the attack by flipping 4th, 6th, 10th, 20th, 24th and 36th bits of the message.
Run simulate.py for the illustration.
